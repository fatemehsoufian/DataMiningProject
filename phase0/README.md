# University of Newcastle Course Crawler

This Python project allows you to crawl [The University of Newcastle, Australia](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/) website to collect data about its courses and save them in a CSV file for further use. The project utilizes the Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries for web scraping.

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- Beautiful Soup library
- ChromeDriver (or any other WebDriver for Selenium)

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

`pip install selenium beautifulsoup4`

## Usage

3. Download and install ChromeDriver (if you haven't already) from the official website: [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
  
4. Modify the `config.py` file to specify the target URL and any other desired configurations.
  
5. Run the crawler script:
  
  `python crawler.py`
  

6. The script will launch a browser instance, navigate to the specified URL, scrape the course data, and save it to a CSV file.
